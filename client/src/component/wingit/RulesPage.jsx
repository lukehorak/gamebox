        <p className="par-2">One player won't get the prompt, and instead will be told to "Just Wing It" (ðŸ˜‰ get it?). His/her goal is to try and blend with others without knowing the task themselves. During this phase, don't talk to eachother (or do, I'm not a cop. But the game's more fun if you don't!)</p>

        <p className="par-3">After a brief period, the question will be sent to everyone, and you all will have about 20 seconds to vote on who you think is Wingin' It!â„¢ <br/>(but not actually trademarked. We don't have "trademarking things" money!) </p>
          
        <p className="par-4">The vote has to be unanimous (minus one, because who's going to vote for themselves?) for it to count, so talk it out! </p>
